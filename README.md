**Cloud Choice** is an instant search app, for games catalog offers from every **cloud gaming platform**.

The idea is to be able to centralize, and facilitate the search for games and the choice of platforms Quickly.
Soon and gradually, Cloud-choice will integrate the game listing APIs (unofficial) of all existing cloud gaming services:

- Geforce Now - Ready and Auto synchronised
- Stadia - Ready and Auto synchronised
- Boosteroid - Soon
- Xcloud - Ready and Auto synchronised
- Playstation Now - soon
- Luna - Soon


The objective in terms of **API**, is to limit the interventions on the code as much as possible, and to have lists of games which will be synchronized automatically.

The application is a **SPA** ( Single Page Application) and **PWA** ( Progressive Web App).

Thanks to the fact that it will be a PWA, it can be installed on Desktop as well as on mobile and all OS.

An Apk build, will certainly coming  soon too for "Cloud Choice".
