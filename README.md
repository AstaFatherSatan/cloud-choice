<b>The Progressive Web App:</b> <br>

The objective about API's , is to limit the interventions on the code as much as possible, and to have lists of games which will be synchronized automatically daily.

The application is a **SPA** ( Single Page Application) and **PWA** ( Progressive Web App).

Thanks to the fact that it will be a PWA, it can be installed on Desktop as well as on mobile and all OS.

An Apk build, will certainly coming  soon for "Cloud Choice".
