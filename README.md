# Cloud-Choice


**Cloud Choice** is an instant search app for game catalog offers from every **cloud gaming platform**.

The idea is to be able to centralize and facilitate the search for games and the choice of platforms.

At the beginning of the project and in its Beta version, only the **Geforce Now API** is available.

Soon and gradually, Cloud-choice will integrate the game listing APIs (unofficial) of all existing cloud gaming services:

 - Gforce Now
- Stadia
- Boosteroid
- Xbox Cloud Gaming
- Playstation Now
- Luna

The objective in terms of **API**, is to limit the interventions on the code as much as possible, and to have lists of games which will be synchronized automatically.

The application is a **SPA** ( Single Page Application) and **PWA** ( Progressive Web App).

Thanks to the fact that it will be a PWA, it can be installed on Desktop as well as on mobile and all OS.
